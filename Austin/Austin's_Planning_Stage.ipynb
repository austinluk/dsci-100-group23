    "| Variable | Type | Meaning |\n",
    "|-----------|------|---------|\n",
    "| `experience` | Categorical | Player skill level (e.g., Beginner, Amateur, Pro, Veteran, Expert). |\n",
    "| `subscribe` | Boolean | Whether the player has a premium subscription. |\n",
    "| `hashedEmail` | String | Unique hashed identifier |\n",
    "| `played_hours` | Numeric | Total hours spent playing. |\n",
    "| `name` | String | Player's name |\n",

    "#### 1. Histogram: Player Playtime\n",
    "A histogram of `played_hours` shows that most players have very low playtime (under 5 hours),  \n",
    "while a few have extremely high values.  \n",
    "This shows a right-skewed distribution, meaning a small group of players are very active.\n",

    "#### 2. Bar Chart: Experience and Subscription\n",
    "A bar chart of `experience` vs `subscribe` shows that players with higher experience levels  \n",
    "(e.g., Pro or Veteran) tend to subscribe more often.  \n",
    "Less experienced players are less likely to pay for premium features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Histogram: Age Distribution\n",
    "A histogram of `age` shows most players are between 15 and 30 years old.  \n",
    "There are a few older players, but very few children under 10.  \n",
    "This helps us understand which age group dominates the player base.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Scatter Plot: Playtime vs Age\n",
    "A scatter plot of `played_hours` vs `age`, colored by `subscribe`, shows that players who play longer are more likely to subscribe.  \n",
    "However, there is no clear pattern between age and playtime — engagement varies across ages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Facet Plot: Playtime by Gender\n",
    "Using facets to separate genders, we see that both male and female players show a similar pattern —  \n",
    "To understand which gender is more likely to play longer.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "This may show that subscribers play more hours on average and tend to have higher experience levels. "

    "## (4) Methods and Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposed Method\n",
    "- I will use the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm to predict whether a player will subscribe to a premium service based on their age, gender, experience, and total hours played.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Method Is Appropriate\n",
    "- KNN is a simple method that makes predictions based on similarity between players.\n",
    "- It’s easy to understand and interpret visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "- Data points that are close together in feature space have similar outcomes.  \n",
    "- The distance metric (usually Euclidean) accurately reflects similarity.  \n",
    "- Features should be normalized so no variable dominates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- KNN can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers.  \n",
    "- The choice of k (number of neighbours) strongly affects accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Comparison and Selection\n",
    "- Different k values will be tested (e.g., k = 3, 5,..., n) using cross-validation to find the best-performing model.  \n",
    "- Evaluation will use accuracy, precision and recall performance against a baseline model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Processing Plan\n",
    "- Split the data into 80% training** and 0% testing sets.  \n",
    "- Normalize numeric features (`age`, `played_hours`) so all variables are on the same scale.  \n",
    "- Using 5-fold cross-validation on the training data to tune `k`.  \n",
    "- Evaluate the final model on the test data.\n"
